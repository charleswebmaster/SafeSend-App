# SafeSend-App
The SafeSend mobile app is an app that enables users to send and receive confidential messages with a focus on security and privacy. As a user, you can input a message, optionally set a passphrase as a password for accessing the message, and specify an expiration period for the message's availability in different units of time (seconds, minutes, hours, or days).

Once submitted, the SafeSend Mobile app generates a unique link for the message, which you can directly share via various social media chats such as WhatsApp, Email, Twitter X, or copy it to the clipboard.

The recipient can use the link to access the message. If the sender sets a passphrase, sender must also send the recipient the set passphrase separately, the recipient must enter the correct passphrase to view the message. SafeSend allows the recipient to view the message up to two times before it expires or becomes inaccessible.

Overall, the SafeSend Mobile App provides a secure and user-friendly method of sharing sensitive messages with time-limited access.
